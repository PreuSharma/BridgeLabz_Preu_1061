/*
A Linked List in JavaScript is a dynamic data structure where each element (called a node) contains two parts:

Data: The value stored in the node.
Next: A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list.

Types of Linked Lists:
Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node and the last node points to null.
Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next and the previous nodes.
Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the head node, forming a circle.
